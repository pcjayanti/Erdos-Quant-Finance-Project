There are two Jupyter notebooks, and a powerpoint presentation, submitted as part of my deliverables for my final project for the Fall 2025 Quant Finance bootcamp by The Erdos Institute.

The powerpoint presentation is a brief summary of the results from the project, and there is also an accompanying video summary at
